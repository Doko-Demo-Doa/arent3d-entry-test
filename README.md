Entry test submission for Arent3D, powered by NextJS and Mantine UI kit + Typescript

## Requirements

- NodeJS 16+ (latest LTS, which should be 18 by now, is recommended)

## Tools used

- Zustand
- Mantine Kit (seriously, this is too good to use in this kind of project)
- NextJS (so I don't need to care about setting up routing, also Vercel can host it for me)

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
